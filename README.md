# Financial Machine Learning Blueprints

A practical portfolio of financial machine learning projects inspired by *Machine Learning and Data Science Blueprints for Finance* and *Advances in Financial Machine Learning*.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate **reproducible, theory-grounded, and practitioner-oriented** approaches to applying data science and machine learning in financial markets.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build end-to-end financial ML projects grounded in empirical market behavior
* Highlight common pitfalls in applying ML to financial time series
* Emphasize reproducibility, interpretability, and real-world constraints
* Create a public portfolio suitable for both employment and independent work

## 📌 Current Blueprint

### 01 — Stylized Facts of Financial Returns

* Non-normality and fat tails
* Skewness and excess kurtosis
* Why standard ML assumptions fail in finance
* Implications for risk modeling and trading strategies

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Stack

* Python
* NumPy, pandas, scipy
* matplotlib / seaborn
* scikit-learn
* Jupyter / Google Colab

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* This repository is **educational and research-oriented**
* It does **not** provide financial advice
* Results are illustrative and subject to market limitations such as noise, non-stationarity, and transaction costs

---

## 📈 Roadmap

* Feature engineering for financial time series
* Supervised ML models for returns and volatility
* Cross-validation in time series
* Backtesting frameworks and evaluation metrics
* Risk-aware model assessment
